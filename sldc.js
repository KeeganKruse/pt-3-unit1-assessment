// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Testing & Integration
// Implementation
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in this step the requirements of the software are determined. This step is typically where developers will work with the customer/market analysts to define clearly the requirements of the software."
const design = "This is the third step, in which the design architect will  typically determine the overall architecture of the product being developed, they will use the information provided by the customer/market analyst to complete the design of the software."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the forth step, in this step the software will typically be tested for any errors, bugs or vulnerabilities and integrated into use in a controlled environment."
const implementation = "This is the fifth step, in this step the software will typically be implemented into the everyday use of the consumer."
const maintain = "This is the sixth step, this step is where the maintainance updates of the software will be completed as well as performance evaluations and making any changes to the initial software."
